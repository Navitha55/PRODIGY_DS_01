Creating a Bar or Histogram Visualization You can use this code to create a bar or histogram visualization of the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in your population dataset. For example, you can visualize the distribution of ages or gender in the population.

## Population Age Distribution Visualization

This project allows you to create a bar chart to visualize the age distribution within a population dataset. It's a tool for gaining insights into the age demographics of a population.

## Introduction

Understanding the distribution of ages within a population is crucial for various analyses and decision-making processes. This project simplifies the process by providing a Python script to create a bar chart visualisation.

## steps to do..!

1.Preparing data :-
 - Ensure you have the relevant population data in an Excel file (e.g., "dataset.xlsx") located in the same directory as your script.
 - The Excel file should contain a column with age data
   
2.Decoding the code :-
- Open a Python code editor .
- Copy and paste the provided code for creating a bar chart visualization into your Python code editor
  
Note :- "Ensure that you have installed matplotlib ,pandas , os and numpy modules."

3.Executing the Visualization :-
 - Run the code.
 - The code will load the data, process it, and create a bar chart representing the age distribution in the population dataset.

## Customization
You can customise the visualisation by making the following modifications to the code:

 - Adjust the appearance of the bar chart, such as labels, colours, and size, to suit your preferences
